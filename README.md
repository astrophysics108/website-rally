# Rally - make a shared website!

This is a community driven website where everyone can add their own contribution to the website!

We are using vanilla TS that is built with Vite!

The website is hosted at website-rally.dev by our friends over at Youthacks <3

If you're new to HTML and static web development, check out this [tutorial](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/web-intro) from the Raspberry Pi Foundation!!

- Fork the base repository and clone your fork.
- Run `npm run dev` to start a development web server at `localhost:5173`.
- Create a directory that is called the same as your project name *inside the `public` and `src` folders*. Place any static files in your `public` folder and any dynamic files in your `src` folder.
- Add a link to your directory in `links.html` to allow other people to find your work.
- Make sure that your site builds by running `npm run build`.
- Open a PR back into the base repository.
- Our reviewers will take a look!

Please don't touch any files other than `public/links.html` and the files in the directory you created.

If, for any reason you'd like to install a package, open a GitHub issue with the `new package request` tag, explaining what the package is and why you need it. A reviewer will get back to you shortly.

Your PR will be requested to have changes made or be closed if any edits to any base files are made without prior request or good reason.

No inappropriate content, PR's with anything that violates our CoC will be closed. Mild swear words are allowed.
